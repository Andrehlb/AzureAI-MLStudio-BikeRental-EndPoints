# AzureAI-MLStudio-BikeRental-EndPoints

Welcome to the **AzureAI MLStudio BikeRental Endpoints** repository! In this project, we explore the world of bike rentals using Azure AI services and the powerful capabilities of Azure Machine Learning Studio. Our focus is on creating and configuring endpoints to make predictions related to bike rentals.

## Overview
- **AzureAI**: This section showcases our expertise in Microsoft's Azure platform, specifically its AI services.
- **MLStudio**: We leverage Azure Machine Learning Studio to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- **BikeRental**: Our project revolves around bike rental data, where we predict rental counts and configure endpoints for easy access.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**: Learn about the purpose of this project and its significance.
2. **Getting Started**: Follow step-by-step instructions to set up and run our code.
3. **Dependencies**: Understand any prerequisites or dependencies required for successful execution.
4. **Endpoint Configuration**: Dive into the details of how we configure endpoints for our bike rental predictions.
5. **Contributing**: Interested in contributing? Find out how you can get involved.
6. **License**: Review the licensing terms for this project.

## Data Export and Git Integration

We exported data from Azure AI Studio in CSV and JSONL formats. The exported files were saved locally and then added to this Git repository. Here are the steps we followed:

1. Navigate to the repository directory in the terminal: `cd /d/reposGitHub/AzureAI-MLStudio-BikeRental-EndPoints`
2. Add the files to Git: `git add results_oxygen_bike-automl/results-mslearn-yellow_oxygen_bike-automl.csv` and `git add results_oxygen_bike-automl/results-mslearn-yellow_oxygen_bike-automl.jsonl`
3. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Add exported data files from Machine Learning Studio Laboratorioai900>Jobs>mslearn-yellow_oxygen_bike-rental"`
4. Push the changes to GitHub: `git push`

Feel free to explore our code, experiment with the endpoints, and contribute to our bike rental prediction journey! 🚴‍♂️📊
